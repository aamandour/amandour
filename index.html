                At StudentsBoat, I co-founded a startup to assist students,
                particularly international students, in connecting with each
                other when they come to a new country or city. Our platform,
                StudentsBoat.com, creates a marketplace for shared
                accommodation, allowing students to rent rooms or beds with host
                families or other students who have apartments. I participated
                in the Everyday Entrepreneurship (EE) competition at the Center
                for Entrepreneurship at Portland State University (PSU) and won
                the 3rd prize. Additionally, I joined the 45Camp pre-accelerator
                program sponsored by VertueLab, where we graduated with valuable
                experience and a support award. Our slogan, "feel at home
                wherever you roam," encapsulates our mission to make students
                feel at home no matter where they are.

                  At Alamah360, We revolutionized property sales by integrating
                  the latest technology, becoming our website's first company to
                  use 360-degree technology. This allowed us to present
                  properties with comprehensive details, including evaluations
                  and price range ratings.
